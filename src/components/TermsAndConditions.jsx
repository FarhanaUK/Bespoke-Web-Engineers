          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">2. Pricing and Payment</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            The pricing for our services is based on the scope of work required. A non-refundable deposit of 50% is required to initiate the project. The remaining 50% is due upon the website's launch.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Payment for monthly maintenance will be invoiced monthly and must be paid on or before the 1st day of each month.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Payments can be made via Stripe using a bank card. Other methods may be available upon request.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Late Payments:</strong> If the final 50% of the payment is not received on time, the website will be taken down, and a late fee of 5% of the final amount per week will be added to the outstanding balance. If payment is not received after 14 days, the agreement may be terminated.
          </p>
    
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">3. Ownership</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Upon full payment, the client will have full ownership of the website, including the code, design, domain, and hosting setup. If third-party assets (e.g., stock images or third-party libraries) are used, the ownership will remain with us unless otherwise agreed. If the client wishes to obtain the rights to those assets, additional licensing fees may apply.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            If the client terminates the agreement before the completion of the project, the client will be liable for payment for the work completed up to that point, including any expenses incurred.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            If we terminate the agreement, we will provide the client with any deliverables completed up until the termination date, and the client will not be liable for further payments beyond that point.
          </p>
    
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">5. Monthly Maintenance</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Monthly maintenance is available for Â£[amount] per month. It includes regular updates to the website (content updates, security patches, minor bug fixes), but major redesigns or additions of new features are excluded.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            The maintenance agreement will automatically renew each month unless canceled by either party with 30 days written notice.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Payments for maintenance must be made by the 1st of each month. Failure to pay for monthly maintenance may result in suspension of maintenance services.
